## Real-World Example

### Scenario: You buy 100 AAPL tokens @ $150

**What happens**:
1. You pay: 100 × $150 = $15,000 (in GXC or stablecoin)
2. You receive: 100 AAPL tokens
3. Market maker receives: $15,000
4. Market maker provides: 100 AAPL tokens

**Apple's price goes to $155**:
- Your tokens are now worth: 100 × $155 = $15,500
- Your profit: $500
- You can sell anytime

**You sell 100 AAPL tokens @ $155**:
- You receive: $15,500
- Market maker buys back: 100 AAPL tokens
- Settlement: Cash/crypto (NOT real shares)

**What you did NOT get**:
- You did NOT become an Apple shareholder
- You did NOT get voting rights
- You did NOT get dividends
- You did NOT get your name on Apple's registry

**What you DID get**:
- You made $500 profit from price movement
- You traded 24/7 (not just market hours)
- You settled instantly (not T+2)
- You paid lower fees

## How Dilution Works

### Scenario: Apple does 2-for-1 stock split

**Real World (Robinhood)**:
- You own: 100 shares @ $150 = $15,000
- After split: 200 shares @ $75 = $15,000
- Your shares doubled, price halved

**GXC Blockchain**:
- You own: 100 tokens @ $150 = $15,000
- After split: 100 tokens @ $75 = $7,500
- Your tokens stay same, price halved

**Wait, you lost money?**

No! Because:
- GXC tokens track **value**, not **share count**
- Your 100 tokens still represent same exposure
- If you want 200 tokens, buy 100 more @ $75
- Total cost: $15,000 (same as before)

**Why this works**:
- Synthetic tokens track price, not cap table
- Dilution is reflected in price automatically
- No minting needed
- Simpler and cleaner

## Risks

### What Can Go Wrong:

1. **Market Maker Default**

2. **Price Feed Manipulation**
   - If market maker provides fake prices, you get bad execution
   - Mitigation: Price sources are logged (Bloomberg, Reuters, etc.)

3. **No Legal Recourse**
   - You don't own real shares, so no shareholder protections
   - Mitigation: Blockchain provides transparency and traceability

4. **Settlement Risk**
   - Market maker may not honor settlement
   - Mitigation: Smart contracts enforce settlement

5. **Regulatory Risk**
   - Regulations may change
   - Mitigation: GXC designed for compliance
