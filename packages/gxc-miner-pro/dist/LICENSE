                          MINING SOFTWARE DISCLAIMER
================================================================================

1. CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING RISKS
   Mining cryptocurrency involves significant risks including but not limited to:
   - Electricity costs may exceed mining rewards
   - Hardware wear and potential damage
   - Market volatility affecting profitability
   - Regulatory changes in your jurisdiction
   - Pool fees and network fees

2. NO GUARANTEE OF PROFITS
   This software does not guarantee any profits from mining activities.
   Mining profitability depends on many factors outside the control of
   this software, including network difficulty, cryptocurrency prices,
   electricity costs, and hardware efficiency.

3. POOL MINING TERMS
   When using pool mining, you agree to the terms of service of the
   mining pool operator. Pool operators typically charge fees (1-3%)
   and have their own payout thresholds and policies.

4. SOLO MINING RISKS
   Solo mining requires significant computational resources to find blocks.
   You may mine for extended periods without finding any blocks or rewards.

5. HARDWARE RESPONSIBILITY
   The user is solely responsible for monitoring hardware temperatures,
   power consumption, and ensuring adequate cooling. Mining can increase
   hardware wear and electricity consumption significantly.

6. LEGAL COMPLIANCE
   Users are responsible for ensuring cryptocurrency mining is legal
   in their jurisdiction and for reporting any mining income according
   to local tax laws.

By using this software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
and agree to these terms and conditions.
