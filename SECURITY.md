## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within GXC-core, please do not report it through public issues. Instead, follow the process below to ensure a coordinated disclosure:

1.  **Private Disclosure**: Send a detailed report of the vulnerability to the GXC security team. While we are in the process of setting up a dedicated security email, please contact the repository maintainers directly through secure channels.
2.  **Information to Include**: Provide a clear description of the vulnerability, the potential impact, and a proof-of-concept (PoC) or steps to reproduce the issue.
3.  **Response Timeline**: Our team will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
4.  **Public Disclosure**: We request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had the opportunity to address it and release a patch.

## Security Principles

GXC-core is designed with several built-in security layers:

*   **AI-Powered Sentinel**: Monitors network hashrate and difficulty to detect and mitigate 51% attacks.
*   **Hybrid Consensus**: Alternating PoW and PoS blocks increases the cost of attacking the network.
*   **Traceability Guard**: Every transaction is cryptographically linked to its predecessor, ensuring a verifiable audit trail.

Thank you for helping keep the GXC network safe.
